# Jekyll Autoprefixer [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-autoprefixer.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-autoprefixer)

> Autoprefixer integration for Jekyll

This plugin provides simple autoprefixer support for Jekyll.

## Installation

This plugin is available as a [RubyGem][ruby-gem].

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-autoprefixer'
```

And then execute the `bundle` command to install the gem.

Alternatively, you can also manually install the gem using the following command:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll-autoprefixer
```

After the plugin has been installed successfully, add the following lines to your `_config.yml` in order to tell Jekyll to use the plugin:

```yaml
plugins:
- jekyll-autoprefixer
```

## Getting Started

No additional steps are required. All written CSS files inside the destination
directory are overwritten with the output of autoprefixer.

You can optionally configure the behavior of autoprefixer using the following options in your `_config.yml`:

### `browsers:`

You can specify the browsers for which autoprefixer is supposed to generate prefixes for:

```yaml
autoprefixer:
  browsers:
  - last 2 versions
```

### `only_production:`

You can specify that autoprefixer should only work in production mode (i.e. when `JEKYLL_ENV` is `production`).

```yaml
autoprefixer:
  only_production: true # defaults to false
```

### `process_static_files:`

You can tell autoprefixer to not process static files (i.e. files without a YAML frontmatter) by setting `process_static_files:` to `false`,
to mirror the default behavior of Jekyll and most plugins to only transform files that have front matter.

```yaml
autoprefixer:
  process_static_files: false # defaults to true (for legacy reasons)
```

### `sourcemaps:`

You can influence whether sourcemaps are generated by autoprefixer.
If a previous step (e.g. SASS) has already produced a sourcemap, the latter will be used as the base for the new sourcemap:

```yaml
autoprefixer:
  # Possible values:
  #   never - no source maps to be generated or transformed
  #   always - source maps will always be generated resp. transformed
  #   development - source maps will only be generated resp. transformed if JEKYLL_ENV == development
  #   production - source maps will only be generated resp. transformed if JEKYLL_ENV == production
  #
  # Defaults to never.
  sourcemaps: always
```
